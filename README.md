This the blockchain powered to do list.Each task and updation of task would get stored in blockchain.
This project is a decentralized To-Do application built using Ethereum smart contracts, Node.js, and React. The smart contract is deployed on the Sepolia test network via Remix, but you can also deploy it locally using Ganache. Since private keys and RPC API URLs are not included, you must configure your own. If you lack enough faucet funds for Sepolia, simply use Ganache for local deployment. Truffle can be used to create a new Solidity project, and youâ€™ll need to include the contract ABI and address in your setup. Also, ensure the truffle-config.js file is properly configured for deployment on Ganache. The frontend is built with React, providing a seamless user experience for managing tasks on the blockchain.
